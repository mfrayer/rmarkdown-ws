## Printing text from inside a code chunk 

Added August 28, 2019 

This is especially useful if you want to evaluate output in a loop. 

To print in a code chunk, use `cat()` and the chunk option `results="asis"`. It is cleanest if you also use `echo=FALSE`. 

```{r text_in_code, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}

2+2 

cat("\n\n### Test header\n\nExample text.\n\n")

4+4

```
