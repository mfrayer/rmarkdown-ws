# Payseur Lab R Markdown Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to R Markdown and get you to try it out. This will not be comprehensive, but it will get you started. 

## Pre-Workshop Instructions 

You may get more out of the workshop if you bring your own data! If you want, bring an R script you already have, or even just a data set. If you have a big data set on your desktop, you can subset it and save that as an R image using `saveRDS(dataframe, file = "mydata.rds")` and bring that. If you aren't currently using R, just bring a dataset and we can get it loaded in. 

Choose something that you can make simple figures from, or bring the code to make the figure, too. 

Finally, download this workshop. You use the following commands on the command line, or you can download it from this link: https://github.com/mfrayer/rmarkdown-ws.git . If you have a github account, you can fork this repo, but it isn't necessary.

## A Note on Data Example
